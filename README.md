# React Recipes App
Currently under development.

This app was first developed as an evaluative group project of Trybe's Web Development Course.
I'm now recreating it (and other projects) from scratch for these main reasons:
- Gaining a better understading of what it takes to set up all the necessary tools since almost everything was ready for us to start coding.
- Having an opportunity to build all the features by myself, as it was a group project and many of them were built by other people.
- Getting more used to commiting more often and using conventional commits.
- Having more freedom for choosing how and what to develop, as there were some limitations because of the project's requirements.
- Having a way of practicing tests more as my knowledge is still lacking a lot in this area.
