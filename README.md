# React Recipes App
Currently under development.

This app was first developed as an evaluative group project of Trybe's Web Development Course.
You can see the complete version with a more descriptive README [here](https://github.com/DanielErhardt/myRecipe-app).

I'm now recreating it from scratch for these main reasons:
- Practicing Typescript in a front-end application.
- Learning CSS through an extension.
- Gaining a better understading of what it takes to set up all the necessary tools since almost everything was ready for us to start coding.
- Having an opportunity to build all the features by myself, as it was a group project and many of them were not built by me.
- Getting more used to commiting more often and using conventional commits.
- Having more freedom for choosing how and what to develop, as there were some limitations because of the project's requirements.
- Having a way of practicing tests more as my knowledge is still lacking a lot in this area.
